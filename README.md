# Minesweeper
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.5.

### Description

This app is an attempt at recreating the classic game _minesweeper_.  The user must clear a board of tiles without clicking on a mine.  The initial mvp will just be an 8x8 grid of tiles; tiles will be clickable objects.  Further implementation could possibly add bigger boards.

### Checklist

  * Build board
  * Check for mine/ number
  * If # check for mines nearby
  * Right click to mark mines
  * Clicking a mine ends the game
  * game timer
